I NEED TO SIMULATE TORQUE NOW!!!!

T_motor : Torque = K_T * w^2
where K_T is some number of my choosing (possibly related to the actual prop specs)
and w is the angular velocity

F_motor_thrust : Force = C_T * rho * n^2 * D^4
where C_T is some number
and rho is the density of air (1.225 kg/m^3)
and n is the speed in rev/sec
and D is the diameter of the prop

T_yaw : Torque = (T_1 + T_3) - (T_2 + T_4)
basically, T_1 and T_3 spin the same direction, T_2 and T_4 spin opposite to the latter
this T_yaw should be minimized with the PID

I_z : Momement of Inertia = sum for each motor => (motor_mass * distance_from_center^2)
the moment of inertia

a : angular acceleration = T_yaw / I_z

F : Force = T_yaw / distance_from_center
this is the total tangential force


in summary start with angular velocity
the pid controller will control this

use the angular velocity to calculate the thrust of the props (for the particle sim)
and the torque of the props
use the torque to find the tangential force (for the particle sim)
use the total torque with the yaw PID

some stats:
Motor RPM: 19,000 RPM
Motor weight: 2.95 g

Prop diameter: 1.2 in == 31mm
Prop pitch: 1.9 in
Weight: 0.18 g

(for pitch and roll)
// definitely not right by the way
// how will it ever take off????
// all motors need to have power.
// if the motor is stable, all motors will turn off and it will fall. so true.
// add on a base throttle.

/* google gipity

The Correct "Plus" Configuration:

North: Throttle - PID_Pitch

South: Throttle + PID_Pitch

East: Throttle

West: Throttle

Verdict: Flies perfectly. The N/S motors handle the pitch, while the E/W motors maintain the lift and keep the drone from tipping sideways.
